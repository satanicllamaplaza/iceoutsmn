<h1>Development Plan</h1>

<p>
  This project is bare bones, and if the community uses it, there will need to be
  improvements!
</p>

<h2>Oversight</h2>

<p>
  The goal of this site is to help keep the community safe! Oversight is very important.
  This is something that will come with time and matters heavily to Llama (the admin).
</p>

<h2>Content Moderation</h2>

<p>
  Content moderation is very important! This is how we delete content that distracts from
  or conflicts with this website’s goals. We have a simple moderation method in place for now,
  but its effectiveness will need to be improved over time.
</p>

<h2>Validating Information</h2>

<p>
  Posting I.C.E. sightings is a good start! Unfortunately, it's easy for resources like this
  to lose control and lose their effectiveness. Validating sightings is very important!
  Right now, we are in the community development phase, but eventually we will need to make
  sure that we are posting true information. We do not want to scare our neighbors. As we
  develop this community, we will work on validating claims and making our efforts more robust
  and effective.
</p>

<h2>Translation</h2>

<p>
  As this project builds, we need to be considerate of the communities we are trying to protect.
  Making sure the information is accessible and properly translated is very important.
</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>
  We are not the only resource, and we are far from the most effective resource. We need to make
  a resources page that points people to more robust support networks and information.
